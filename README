May need to install pyPdf as a dependency of islandoraUtils.

Python 2.6 and lxml SOP:
Where necessary modify the install for your architecture, version of EL and previously installed packages.

rpm -ivh http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/5/i386/epel-release-5-4.noarch.rpm'
yum install python26
yum install python26-distribute
yum install python26-devel
yum install gcc
yum install libxslt-devel
easy_install-2.6 lxml

python26

>>>from lxml import etree

If you don't get an error you are home free.

You will need a config file like this
TEST.cfg
